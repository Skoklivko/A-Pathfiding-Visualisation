# A-Pathfiding-Visualisation

What this little program does is
- the user sets a start and an end point, as well as make walls wherever he deems necessary and when you run the program it creates a window from the start to the end point and usese and algorithm in order to find the quickest path to the two points. If there isnt a path that can connect the 2 points it expands the field in order to create a route.

-How to use:
-after running the program choose 2 points on the created screen 
-create walls wherever u want 
-press 'Space' on the keyboard and watch the algorithm do its thing
